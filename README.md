# CustomRaycast
This is a repo where I wrote some test code for a city builder that I am working on. As the name suggests, I started writing a custom raycast solution inside of unity, with my own custom bounding boxes. However, this test repo has grown to include:
- Custom Raycasting
- Struct based non-unity objects
- Custom bounding boxes
- OBJ reconstruction
- COLLADA (.dae) reconstruction
- Vertex-Color based shaders
- Lookup-textures for encoding data into shaders.

This repo has grown quite a lot since I started writing the custom raycast solution, and has lots of useful information in here. Feel free to use in here what you will. I have gotten all I need from it and will move any future developments into thier own respective private repositories.
